*** Gnome Wallpaper Slideshow XML creator ***

Execute the program (either double click in GUI or filename in CLI) will produce an XML file, reference to all image files in working directory and subdirectories recursively, and set them up as slideshow for gnome wallpaper.

The reference of the image files contains full path, so the XML file can be moved to anywhere, but those image should be fixed on there location.

All settings set in the beginning of the program, user can set then by modifying the code.

With the "Autoset" on, the XML file will be moved to ~/.config and this program will try to set the wallpaper automatically.  If it doesn't work out, user may still set that by himself.
